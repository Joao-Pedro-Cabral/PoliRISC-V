# PoliRISC-V

## Description

This project hosts the Verilog description of a RISC-V processor developed at the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo. The following extensions are implemented:

- RV32I
- RV64I
- Zicsr

## Directory Structure

The repository's structure is organized as follows:

.
├── docs/
├── README.md
├── rtl/
├── simulation/
├── synthesis/
├── testbench/
├── toplevel/
├── utils/
└── verible.filelist

Each directory hosts the following resources:

- docs: documentation for the project;
- rtl: Verilog descriptions of the processor's components;
- simulation: simulation files and scripts;
- synthesis: synthesis files and scripts;
- testbench: Verilog testbenches for the processor's components;
- toplevel: toplevel Verilog descriptions for synthesis;
- utils: project-wide utilities
